🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version 14+ or whichever your project uses)

npm or yarn

(If using a database) MongoDB / PostgreSQL / MySQL

Git

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Divyareni/Blog‑application.git
cd Blog‑application


Install backend dependencies:

cd backend
npm install


If there’s a frontend folder:

cd ../frontend
npm install


Copy .env.example to .env and fill in your configuration:

PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/blogdb
JWT_SECRET=yourSecretKey


(Adjust variables as per your setup.)

Run the application (development mode):

cd backend
npm run dev    # or npm start


If there is a frontend:

cd ../frontend
npm start


Then visit http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port) in your browser.

Production Build

For production you may build the frontend and serve via the backend, or deploy frontend and backend separately. For example:

cd frontend
npm run build
# move build folder into backend/public (if configured)


Then configure your webserver / host accordingly.



📋 Usage

After starting the app, open your browser to the configured address (e.g. http://localhost:3000).

Register a new user account or log in if one already exists.

Create a new blog post via “New Post” / “Create” button: give it a title, content, optionally upload an image or select tags.

View all posts via “Home” page. Click any post to view its full detail.

If you are the author of a post, you can edit or delete it.

(Optional) Use search or filter by tags if that functionality is implemented.

🔧 Configuration & Environment Variables

Here are typical environment variables you might configure in .env:

PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/blogdb
JWT_SECRET=yourSecretKey
NODE_ENV=development


If you use cloud services (image hosting, email, etc), include those as well:

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=…
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=…
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=…



🧐 How It Works

The backend exposes RESTful endpoints like:

POST /api/auth/register – register new user

POST /api/auth/login – login and receive JWT

GET /api/posts – list all blog posts

POST /api/posts – create a new post (authenticated)

GET /api/posts/:id – view one post

PUT /api/posts/:id – edit your post

DELETE /api/posts/:id – delete your post

The frontend communicates to backend using these API calls, manages user session (e.g. via localStorage or cookies), shows UI accordingly.

Blog post data is stored in a database (MongoDB / PostgreSQL) with schema like:

{
  "title": "My first post",
  "content": "Hello world!",
  "author": "user_id",
  "createdAt": "...",
  "updatedAt": "...",
  "tags": ["tag1","tag2"],
  "imageUrl": "optional"
}

💡 Why This Setup is Useful

Modular: Backend and frontend separated, easy to maintain and extend.

Extensible: You can add features like comments, likes, subscriptions, search.

Deployable: You can host frontend on static site host, backend on Node host, or combine them.

Learn‑friendly: Good project to learn full‑stack web dev (auth, CRUD, API, DB, UI).
